# llbeirut_images

This repository contains images taken during the data collection process of the Linguistic Landscapes of Beirut project. 

All image manipulation was carried out using the ImageMagick Library. The thumbnails folder contains images shrunken to 300px width. The watermarked folder contains the full images with a tiled watermark. 

Most metadata has been stripped from the images using EXIFTOOL. Refer to the general metadata file for information related to individual images. 

All images are released here with a CC BY-SA 4.0 International license. If you would like to reuse one of the larger format images without the watermark, you may do so using the suggested citation below. Send us a request (llbeirut9 [at] gmail [dot] com) with the name of the file(s) you require, and we will do our best to get back to you in a timely manner.
